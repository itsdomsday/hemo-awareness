This project aims to provide substantial information to the public viewers of this website in the future regarding Hemophilia, a rare genetic bleeding disorder, and gain awareness that will help them provide approriate medical care and support, as this is a very delicate disorder that affects patients in their entire lifetime.

The website was specifically made to be user-friendly and without any complex navigation, to ensure that the viewers will consciously focus on the content that is intend to inform people rather than to be amazed or confused with complex design or layout.

The website was created using HTML, CSS, and with Bootstrap 5 CDN. Photos courtesy of Peter Paul Carreon of Hemophilia Advocates Philippines. Sources of the content will be posted on the Reference section of the page.
