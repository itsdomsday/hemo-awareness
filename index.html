      <p>
        Hemophilia is usually an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does 
        not clot properly. This can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding 
        following injuries or surgery. Blood contains many proteins called clotting 
        factors that can help to stop bleeding. People with hemophilia have low levels 
        of either factor 8 (Hemophilia A) or factor 9 (Hemophilia B). The severity of 
        hemophilia that a person has is determined by the amount of factor in the blood. 
        The lower the amount of the factor, the more likely it is that bleeding will occur 
        which can lead to serious health problems.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you have hemophilia, you might bleed for a longer time after an injury than 
        you would if your blood clotted properly. Small cuts usually aren't much of a 
        problem. If you have a severe form of the condition, the main concern is bleeding 
        inside your body, especially in your knees, ankles and elbows. Internal bleeding 
        can damage your organs and tissues and be life-threatening.
        
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hemophilia is almost always a genetic disorder. Treatment includes regular replacement 
        of the specific clotting factor that is reduced. Newer therapies that don't contain 
        clotting factors also are being used.
      </p>

      <h1 class="text-center" id="causes"><strong>Causes</strong></h1>
      <br />
      <img src="photos/causes-hemophilia.png" alt="Causes of Hemophilia" class="img-fluid rounded float-end ms-3 mb-3">
      <p>
        Hemophilia is caused by a mutation or change, in one of the genes, that provides 
        instructions for making the clotting factor proteins needed to form a blood clot. This 
        change or mutation can prevent the clotting protein from working properly or to be 
        missing altogether. These genes are located on the X chromosome. Males have one X and 
        one Y chromosome (XY) and females have two X chromosomes (XX). Males inherit the X 
        chromosome from their mothers and the Y chromosome from their fathers. Females inherit 
        one X chromosome from each parent.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When a person bleeds, the body typically pools blood cells together to form a clot to 
        stop the bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work with cells known 
        as platelets to form clots. Hemophilia occurs when a clotting factor is missing or levels 
        of the clotting factor are low.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The X chromosome contains many genes that are not present on the Y chromosome. This means 
        that males only have one copy of most of the genes on the X chromosome, whereas females 
        have 2 copies. Thus, males can have a disease like hemophilia if they inherit an affected 
        X chromosome that has a mutation in either the factor VIII or factor IX gene. Females can 
        also have hemophilia, but this is much rarer. In such cases both X chromosomes are affected 
        or one is affected and the other is missing or inactive. In these females, bleeding symptoms 
        may be similar to males with hemophilia.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A female with one affected X chromosome is a “carrier” of hemophilia. Sometimes a female who 
        is a carrier can have symptoms of hemophilia. In addition, she can pass the affected X chromosome 
        with the clotting factor gene mutation on to her children.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Even though hemophilia runs in families, some families have no prior history of family members 
        with hemophilia. Sometimes, there are carrier females in the family, but no affected boys, just 
        by chance. However, about one-third of the time, the baby with hemophilia is the first one in 
        the family to be affected with a mutation in the gene for the clotting factor.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hemophilia can result in:
        <ul>
          <li>Bleeding within joints that can lead to chronic joint disease and pain</li>
          <li>Bleeding in the head and sometimes in the brain which can cause long term problems, such as seizures and paralysis</li>
          <li>Death can occur if the bleeding cannot be stopped or if it occurs in a vital organ such as the brain.</li>
        </ul>

      <h1 class="text-center" id="sands"><strong>Signs and Symptoms</strong></h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Common signs of hemophilia include:
        <ul>
          <li>Bleeding into the joints. This can cause swelling and pain or tightness in the joints; it often affects the knees, elbows, and ankles.</li>
          <li>Bleeding into the skin (which is bruising) or muscle and soft tissue causing a build-up of blood in the area (called a hematoma).</li>
          <li>Bleeding of the mouth and gums, and bleeding that is hard to stop after losing a tooth.</li>
          <li>Bleeding after circumcision (surgery performed on male babies to remove the hood of skin, called the foreskin, covering the head of the penis).</li>
          <li>Bleeding after having shots, such as vaccinations.</li>
          <li>Bleeding in the head of an infant after a difficult delivery.</li>
          <li>Blood in the urine or stool.</li>
          <li>Frequent and hard-to-stop nosebleeds.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hemophilia occurs in about 1 of every 5,000 male births. Based on recent study that used 
        data collected on patients receiving care in federally funded hemophilia treatment centers 
        during the period 2012-2018, about 20,000 as many as 33,000 males in the United States are 
        living with the disorder. Hemophilia A is about four times as common as hemophilia B, and 
        about half of those affected have the severe form. Hemophilia affects people from all racial 
        and ethnic groups.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Signs and symptoms of hemophilia vary, depending on your level of clotting factors. If your 
        clotting-factor level is mildly reduced, you might bleed only after surgery or trauma. If your 
        deficiency is severe, you can bleed easily for seemingly no reason.

      <img src="photos/diag.jpg" alt="Diagnosis" class="img-fluid rounded float-end ms-3 mb-3" height="512" width="512">
      <p>
        Many people who have or have had family members with hemophilia will ask that their baby 
        boys get tested soon after birth. About one-third of babies who are diagnosed with hemophilia 
        have a new mutation not present in other family members. In these cases, a doctor might check 
        for hemophilia if a newborn is showing certain signs of hemophilia. To make a diagnosis, doctors 
        would perform certain blood tests to show if the blood is clotting properly. If it does not, then 
        they would do clotting factor tests, also called factor assays, to diagnose the cause of the bleeding 
        disorder. These blood tests would show the type of hemophilia and the severity.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Severe cases of hemophilia usually are diagnosed within the first year of life. Mild forms might 
        not be apparent until adulthood. Some people learn they have hemophilia after they bleed excessively 
        during a surgical procedure.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Clotting-factor tests can reveal a clotting-factor deficiency and determine how severe the hemophilia is.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For people with a family history of hemophilia, genetic testing might be used to identify carriers to make 
        informed decisions about becoming pregnant.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It's also possible to determine during pregnancy if the fetus is affected by hemophilia. However, the testing 
        poses some risks to the fetus. Discuss the benefits and risks of testing with your doctor.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="fs-3"><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
      <p>
        The main treatment for severe hemophilia involves replacing the clotting factor you 
        need through a tube in a vein.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This replacement therapy can be given to treat a bleeding episode in progress. It can 
        also be given on a regular schedule at home to help prevent bleeding episodes. Some 
        people receive continuous replacement therapy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Replacement clotting factor can be made from donated blood. Similar products, called 
        recombinant clotting factors, are made in a laboratory, not from human blood.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The best way to treat hemophilia is to replace the missing blood clotting factor so 
        that the blood can clot properly. This is done by infusing (administering through a 
        vein) commercially prepared factor concentrates. People with hemophilia can learn how 
        to perform these infusions themselves so that they can stop bleeding episodes and, by 
        performing the infusions on a regular basis (called prophylaxis), can even prevent 
        most bleeding episodes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Good quality medical care from doctors and nurses who know a lot about the disorder 
        can help prevent some serious problems. Often the best choice for care is to visit 
        an available Hemophilia treament centers in your area. These centers not only provide 
        care to address all issues related to the disorder, but also provides health education 
        that helps people with hemophilia stay healthy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="photos/treat.jpg" alt="Treatment" class="img-fluid rounded float-start ms-3 mb-3" height="512" width="512">
      <p>
        About 15-20 percent of people with hemophilia develop an antibody (called an inhibitor) 
        that stops the clotting factors from being able to clot the blood and stop bleeding. 
        Treatment of bleeding episodes becomes extremely difficult, and the cost of care for a 
        person with an inhibitor can skyrocket because more clotting factor or a different type 
        of clotting factor is needed. People with inhibitors often experience more joint disease 
        and other problems from bleeding that result in a reduced quality of life.
