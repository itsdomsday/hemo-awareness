  <!-- First post - What is Hemophilia -->
  <div class="row p-5">

      <p>
        Hemophilia is usually an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does 
        not clot properly. This can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding 
        following injuries or surgery. Blood contains many proteins called clotting 
        factors that can help to stop bleeding. People with hemophilia have low levels 
        of either factor VIII (8) or factor IX (9). The severity of hemophilia that a 
        person has is determined by the amount of factor in the blood. The lower the 
        amount of the factor, the more likely it is that bleeding will occur which can 
        lead to serious health problems.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        If you have hemophilia, you might bleed for a longer time after an injury than 
        you would if your blood clotted properly. Small cuts usually aren't much of a 
        problem. If you have a severe form of the condition, the main concern is bleeding 
        inside your body, especially in your knees, ankles and elbows. Internal bleeding 
        can damage your organs and tissues and be life-threatening.
        
      </p>
      
      <br />

      <p>
        Hemophilia is almost always a genetic disorder. Treatment includes regular replacement 
        of the specific clotting factor that is reduced. Newer therapies that don't contain 
        clotting factors also are being used.
      </p>

  <!-- Second content - Causes -->
  <div class="row p-5">
    <div class="col-md shadow-lg bg-post p-5 fs-5">
      <h1 class="text-center" id="causes"><strong>Causes</strong></h1>
      <br />
      <img src="photos/causes-hemophilia.png" alt="Causes of Hemophilia" class="img-fluid rounded float-end ms-5 mb-5">
      <p>
        Hemophilia is caused by a mutation or change, in one of the genes, that provides 
        instructions for making the clotting factor proteins needed to form a blood clot. This 
        change or mutation can prevent the clotting protein from working properly or to be 
        missing altogether. These genes are located on the X chromosome. Males have one X and 
        one Y chromosome (XY) and females have two X chromosomes (XX). Males inherit the X 
        chromosome from their mothers and the Y chromosome from their fathers. Females inherit 
        one X chromosome from each parent.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        When a person bleeds, the body typically pools blood cells together to form a clot to 
        stop the bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work with cells known 
        as platelets to form clots. Hemophilia occurs when a clotting factor is missing or levels 
        of the clotting factor are low.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        The X chromosome contains many genes that are not present on the Y chromosome. This means 
        that males only have one copy of most of the genes on the X chromosome, whereas females 
        have 2 copies. Thus, males can have a disease like hemophilia if they inherit an affected 
        X chromosome that has a mutation in either the factor VIII or factor IX gene. Females can 
        also have hemophilia, but this is much rarer. In such cases both X chromosomes are affected 
        or one is affected and the other is missing or inactive. In these females, bleeding symptoms 
        may be similar to males with hemophilia.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        A female with one affected X chromosome is a “carrier” of hemophilia. Sometimes a female who 
        is a carrier can have symptoms of hemophilia. In addition, she can pass the affected X chromosome 
        with the clotting factor gene mutation on to her children.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        Even though hemophilia runs in families, some families have no prior history of family members 
        with hemophilia. Sometimes, there are carrier females in the family, but no affected boys, just 
        by chance. However, about one-third of the time, the baby with hemophilia is the first one in 
        the family to be affected with a mutation in the gene for the clotting factor.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        Hemophilia can result in:
        <ul>
          <li>Bleeding within joints that can lead to chronic joint disease and pain</li>
          <li>Bleeding in the head and sometimes in the brain which can cause long term problems, such as seizures and paralysis</li>
          <li>Death can occur if the bleeding cannot be stopped or if it occurs in a vital organ such as the brain.</li>
        </ul>
