        <p>
            This website aims to provide substantial information to the public viewers of 
            this website in the future regarding Hemophilia, a rare genetic bleeding disorder, 
            and gain awareness that will help them provide approriate medical care and support, 
            as this is a very delicate disorder that affects patients' daily life in their entire lifetime. 
            The website was specifically made to be user-friendly and without any complex navigation, 
            to ensure that the viewers will consciously focus on the content that is intended to inform 
            people rather than to be amazed or confused with complex design or layout.

            This website was created by Dominic Gil Cristobal, a 30-year-old KodeGo student that aims to find his way back to Web Development 
            career. Dominic is also born with a moderate Hemophilia A, and suffers the same pain as described on this website. Due to the rarity 
            of this bleeding disorder, Dominic aims to spread awareness of this disorder, in the hopes that people can provide help and support 
            to those people in need, who are also suffering the same disorder as him.
        </p>
        <p class="text-start">
            As for Dominic's career history, Dominic is a college graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from STI College. Dominic 
            has experienced working as a Web Developer last 2015, helped create an electronic medical record for nursing homes in United States. 
            After the project was completed, the contract was ended and Dominic was not able to help in maintaining the website. Due to the fast growing of 
            technology, Dominic was not able to get hired in the same line of career due to lack of programming language in demand and experiences, he 
            settled instead in BPO industry for 4 years.
